## Welcome to the AI-READI Cohort EHR Data Acquisition Workstream

The AI-READI cohort consent form was obtained to enable the querying of EHR data. The cohort's EHR data is sourced from the following participating sites: UCSD, UAB, and UW. The longitudinal EHR data includes a ten-year lookback period and is exported in the OMOP CDM format. This dataset includes demographics, diagnoses, procedures, medications, laboratory result values, and other salient clinical findings and observations, along with event timelines.
